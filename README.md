# **GitHub History of Scala Language**

**Descriptions and Overview**
- With almost 30k commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature programming language. It is a general-purpose programming language that has recently become another prominent language for data scientists. Scala is also an open source project. Open source projects have the advantage that their entire development histories -- who made changes, what was changed, code reviews, etc. -- publicly available.I'm going to read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). I will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

**Pull requests of Special Developers**
- Plotting the graph of the Developers.

**Contributions of each Developers**
- As mentioned before, it is important to make a distinction between the global expertise and contribution levels and the contribution levels at a more granular level (file, submodule, etc.) In our case, I want to see which of our two developers of interest have the most experience with the code in a given file. I will measure experience by the number of pull requests submitted that affect that file and how recent those pull requests were submitted.
